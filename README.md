# TinyMind

TinyMind is a website that lets you write and sync your blog posts, short thoughts, and memos by signing in with GitHub. Here's how it works:

1. We create a public repo called "tinymind-blog" in your GitHub account.
2. When you write anything on our webpage, it automatically commits to your `yourname/tinymind-blog` repo.
3. This ensures a seamless way to create content and maintain data persistence.

## Data Privacy & Permissions

We only have write access to your public repositories. Your privacy matters:

- Content stored only in your GitHub repo
- No data kept on our servers
- You have full control through your GitHub account

## TODO

- [ ] Create a page to showcase all public writers using TinyMind (creator list)
- [ ] Implement shareable user main pages (like https://tinywind.me/mazzzystar)

## Tech Stack

Built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, NextAuth.js, and Tailwind CSS.
